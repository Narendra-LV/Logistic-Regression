High accuracy classification using Logistic Regression - out of the box!
This model acheived high accuracy (76%) and recall score (70%) out of the box using following methods/ techniques/steps:
1. Used stratified sampling method
2. Used balanced class weights to compensate imbalance in the target variable
3. Excluded zeros from the independent variables before calculating the Mean for imputing
4. Excluded variables that had negative/little/ no influence on prediction
